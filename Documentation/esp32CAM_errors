esp32CAM erros:
1. "Connecting to WiFi..." wont stop show up:
       this means the esp32 cant connetc to the wifi. try checking if your network settings are the same as the one hard-coded in secrets.h.

2. "Camera capture failed" 
       this might mean that thre is a problem with you HW, as we have cleared the SPIFF and yet the camera filed. try changing to another esp32CAM 

3. "Failed to obtain time"
       this may be realted to your wifi connection, try restarting and log into your wifi again.
        
4. "An Error has occurred while mounting SPIFFS"
       this might mean that thre is a problem with you HW, try changing to another esp32CAM

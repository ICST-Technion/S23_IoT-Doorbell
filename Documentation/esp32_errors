ESP32 erros:
1. "Connecting to WiFi..." wont stop show up:
       this means the esp32 cant connetc to the wifi. try checking if your network settings are the same as the one hard-coded in secrets.h.

2. "An Error has occurred while mounting SPIFFS"
        this might mean that thre is a problem with you HW, try changing to another esp32 

3. "Download failed"
        this means that firebase failed in downloading the audio file to the SPIFFS, try checking that there is a file in your firebase Storage called /message.wav
